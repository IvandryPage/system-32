### // STATUS: STALLED / RESEARCH ARCHIVE
> **System Log:** Development is currently suspended. This repository is preserved as a technical record of my exploration into the **.NET MAUI** framework and the implementation of cross-platform UI/UX.

---

### // OVERVIEW
**system32** is a conceptual self-improvement engine inspired by the "System" mechanics found in modern media (*Solo Leveling*). The project aims to digitize the path to personal mastery by generating randomized "Daily Quests"—converting abstract self-improvement goals into concrete, executable system tasks.

The project served as a primary learning vehicle for mastering **C#** in a multi-platform environment, focusing on how to build responsive interfaces that function across Android, iOS, and Windows from a single codebase.

### // TECHNICAL EXPLORATION
* **Cross-Platform Architecture** | Leveraging **.NET MAUI** to build a unified system capable of deployment across mobile and desktop environments.
* **Deterministic Randomization** | Implementing logic to pull defined "Quests" from a data-driven pool, ensuring varied daily engagement.
* **MVVM Design Pattern** | Utilizing the Model-View-ViewModel pattern to ensure a clean separation between the "System Logic" and the "Visual Interface."
* **System Aesthetic** | Engineering a high-contrast, minimalist UI that mirrors a terminal-based "Leveling" dashboard.

### // TECH STACK
* **Framework** | .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)
* **Language** | C#
* **Styling** | XAML / CSS
* **Environment** | Visual Studio / .NET SDK

### // CORE LOGIC FLOW
The intended lifecycle for **system32** follows a strict loop:
1. **Clock Reset** | The system initializes at 00:00 local time.
2. **Quest Dispatch** | The engine assigns a set of "Defined Quests" (Physical/Intellectual) to the user's dashboard.
3. **Execution & Feedback** | User interaction updates the system state, simulating the "Level Up" progression mechanic.

### // POST-MORTEM
Although development has reached a plateau, the research conducted within **system32** provided a foundational understanding of C# property binding, command handling, and the intricacies of the .NET ecosystem. It remains a blueprint for future gamified logic systems.
